Behemoth is .NET software. You need either the Micrsoft .NET runtime version
3.5 or higher or Mono version 2.0 or higher.

Building Behemoth
=================

Linux
-----

Install Mono runtime, Mono C# 3.0 compiler and NAnt to build.

You are assumed to have X Windows with working OpenGL.

Install the required native libraries using package management:

- DevIL
- PhysFS
- SDL
- SDL_mixer

Build the software with NAnt.

Windows
-------

Some of the native library dlls are harder to find on Windows, so they are
included in the `3rdparty/` subdirectory.

Make sure your .NET Runtime is version 3.5 or higher. Get a version 3.5 or
higher .NET SDK from Microsoft. You can also try using Mono on Windows, this
might require modifying the build file.

Get NAnt version 0.86 or higher from <http://nant.sourceforge.net/>. Try to
build the project.

Mac OS X
--------

Not tested, but might work like Linux.

Troubleshooting
===============

NAnt error on the net-3.5 build option on Windows
-------------------------------------------------

Go to the `bin/` subfolder in the NAnt installation folder, and edit the file
`NAnt.exe.config`. Change the line

    key="SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0a\WinSDKNetFxTools\InstallationFolder"

to

    key="SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.1\WinSDKNetFxTools\InstallationFolder"

A native library isn't found
----------------------------

Finding the native libraries required by the Tao dll files is described in the
corresponding `.dll.config` file of each dll. Look at the names of the native
library files that are searched for your OS. The file installed on your system
might have a different name, eg. `foo.so.1` when the config file is looking
for `foo.so.0`. In this case edit the config file to point to `foo.so.1`.
Instead of editing the config file, making a symlink called `foo.so.0` in the
`3rdparty/` subdir pointing to the installed `foo.so.1` might also work.
